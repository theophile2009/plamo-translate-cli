## Installation

### For macOS

#### Python Version

Ensure you have Python version 3.13 or higher installed. 

#### Dependency Issues

The current version of the `sentencepiece` package on PyPI (latest version: 0.2.0) is not compatible with Python 3.13 or higher and CMake 4.0 or higher. This can lead to build errors when attempting to install `sentencepiece` as a dependency for this CLI tool.

However, the latest commit in the main branch of the `sentencepiece` GitHub repository now supports Python 3.13 and CMake 4.0 or higher, though no official release has been made yet. To install `sentencepiece`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `sentencepiece` repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/sentencepiece.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd sentencepiece
   ```

3. Build and install:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

4. Now, install the `plamo-translate-cli` tool:
   ```bash
   pip install plamo-translate-cli
   ```

### Usage

After installation, you can start using the `plamo-translate-cli` tool. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   plamo-translate --text "Your text here" --source "source_language" --target "target_language"
   ```
   Replace `"Your text here"` with the text you want to translate, `"source_language"` with the language code of the source language, and `"target_language"` with the language code of the target language.
